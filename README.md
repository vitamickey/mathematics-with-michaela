# Mathematics with Michaela

## Manifesto

Hi, I'm Michaela, and I think mathematics is pretty cool. But I also know lots of people really do not vibe with maths.

So, I want to create a bunch of freely accessible resources to help students with mathematics. These notes will be applicable to student in Australia, under the ATAR system, but specifically for QCE students in Queensland Senior Secondary.

This is just a personal passion project of mine. Perhaps it will evolve in future.

## Philosophy

I'm hoping that this can help any student, no matter where they sit on the "maths dunce" to "human calculator" spectrum. Mostly, I want these notes to spark some higher-order learning.

Think about things you already know, and how they relate to new topics. Think about similarities, differences, what's important, what might be less important. In the space of my maths class, why are we learning this? What is it going to be useful for?

## Nitty gritty

Written in LaTeX, with poorly tracked comments lol. You can just access the PDFs in each folder. Those are the actually useful notes.
